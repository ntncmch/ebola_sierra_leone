# Comment on Whitty et al.

The result of the model presented in Whitty et al. suggest that, without any intervention, the ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone will peak early December with a maximum of 1600 weekly cases. Here we show that this figure is misleading and call for better practice in presenting modelling results.


The situation in Sierra Leone is: XX s of 18 November 2014. The steady increase of the epidemic shows that the situation is not under control.

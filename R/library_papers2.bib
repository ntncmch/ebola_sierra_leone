annote = {Review:
The authors have addressed most of my comments but they also have added an extra statistical analysis (with very limited details, just the p-value actually) that seems wrong to me. In brief, they have used a paired t-test to compare two (non stationary) time-series, which doesn't make any sense to me. 


Detailed comments:

Page 3, line 46-47:  What samples do the authors aims to compare with the t-test? Does they consider each time series as a random sample from a normal distribution? This approach doesn't make any sense to me. 

The standard H0 for a t-test is ``no difference in the mean'' (which doesn't make any sense since the time-series are obviously not stationary) but the authors report a p-value=0.01 so in principle H0 should be rejected and they should conclude for a difference between the datasets (they conclude the opposite). Perhaps the authors could better explain the test they performed, whether it is actually suitable and define H0 and H1 explicitely.
 
From a conceptual point of view, given that the time-series were generated in two different settings (they are not two independent replicates from the same process) I don't see the point in trying to statistically show that they are not different. Of course they are by nature. Maybe the authors should just compute the correlation between the time-series or use a more suitable test to show that they have similar shapes/timing. 

Page 4, description of the data should be before presentation of the results.

Page 4, ``employees were likely to be adults between 18 and 70''. Are American companies use to employ under 18 and above 70 year-olds? If not, this sentence isn't more informative as saying that employees are likely to be either men or women.

Page 7 and figures, I think there is a confusion about the attack rate as the figures show the incidence/prevalence expressed as a proportion of the whole population. Computing the attack rate seems difficult for the workplace data as these represent weekly prevalence. To compute attack rate, the authors should therefore make some assumptions on how to transform prevalence into incidence data.

annote = {This analysis is based on the assumption that control measures can be implemented at a point similar in the epidemic evolution as in historical outbreaks. This is obviously not the case since the current outbreak is the largest to date, and control measures are becoming more and more difficult to implement as the number of cases continues to increase.

Many data points are out of the credible intervals which indicates that the model doesn't capture the variability of the current and past outbreaks. In particular, the most recent data points for Sierra Leone and Guinea are well above the upper bound of the credible intervals (Figure 2).

Plotting the cumulated number of cases makes difficult to see most recent changes in the outbreaks dynamics. I attach the incidence between WHO reports up to 5 sept (the last report date used by the author in their analysis). It clearly shows that the epidemics in Liberia and Sierra Leone have seen a recent increases, which is less apparent from the cumulated number of cases presented in the paper.

Furthermore, by mapping the authors predictions for the time of the peaks (red dashed line + vertical solid lines for 95% CI) of the epidemics to the WHO incidence time-series, it clearly appears that these predictions are wrong for Sierra Leone (there is a large increase of cases 2 weeks after the higer peak time estimate) and probably also for Liberia (the model predicts that the epidemic will peak in a few weeks thanks to containment measures, which seems very optimistic given the current reports that come from this country). This seems to indicate that the method used by the author is unable to give reliable prediction for the peak time and thus also for the final size.


The logistic model is too simplistic and doesn't describe the transmission process in a mechanistic way. Consequently, it is difficult to interpret and not useful in practice as it doesn't inform how the contaiment startegy should be implemented. Actually, the model assumes that containment will be succesfull but doesn't give any information on how this will be achieved. It just extra-polates this in a phenomelogical way from previous outbreaks.

The estimation method doesn't include any under-reporting. Instead, the authors rescale their estimates to account for potential under-reporting. But this assumes a constant under-reporting which is unlikely to be the case given the duration of the epidemic. Time-varying under-reporting should instead be included in the inference framework (at least for the current outbreak, which occurs on a much longer time span than past outbreaks)

Although this framework seems interesting to synthetise information from past outbreak I don't think it can be used in real time to make such critical predictions (final size, time of the peak) when the epidemic is still in the exponential phase.
 
Can the authors explain how there model can predict the final size of an outbreak for which the peak hasn't been reached yet and with so many under-reporting? At least they should assess the predictive power of their bayesian framework using the data from past outbreaks in a retrospective analysis (i.e cut some of the past outbreaks before their peak and try to predict when it will occur and what will be the final size, and then compare these with what actually happened).

line 43: "the modelled parameters are broadly similar between EVD species". I don't think this affirmation hold for the carying capacity since it is plotted on a log-scale. Also, I would be curious to see the posterior estimates of the standard deviation of the observation noise.  

There is no reference to the Github repository for the code so it's impossible to check whether this analysis is reproducible.

annote = {Review
This is a nice data set and I have a few comments that I hope the authors can address:
1) The authors must state that the 2009 H1N1 event was a pandemic. This is an important information for the reader as I would expect more community and household transmission occuring during the period considered than during a typical influenza season. In particular, the authors should discuss to what extend both sites can be considered closed and independant (as stated in page 2 line 35, page 3 line 32 and page 4 line 4). Indeed, the possibility of interaction between the two sites (via community acquired infection) could provide a simple explanation to the similar epidemic patterns.
2) the authors must better state the nature of the data and how they were collected, in particular for the University. For instance, are the data collected by one or more University GPs? What criteria were used to define ILI cases? Are there virological confirmation for some of the cases? Do you expect any bias in reporting?
3) I would like to see more summary statistics of the two epidemics (e.g. attack rate, time to reach the epidemic peak, etc). That would help to compare the two sites more quantitatively.
4) The authors should state if they plan to do some model fitting with the data in future work? If not, they should publish the data and indicate in the paper how to access it.
5) In figure 1 it would be helpful to colorize the name and label of the y-axes according to the source of data (black for workplace and grey for university).
6) I wonder if the authors could dislay the school holidays periods on figure 1 as this is expected to be another source of epidemic difference between a workplace and a campus.
7) I would suggest to revise the title as it doesn't reflect that the paper compares the 2009 epidemic between two sites.
